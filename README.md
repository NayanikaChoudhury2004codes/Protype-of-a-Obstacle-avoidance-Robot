Obstacle Avoidance Robot  

Overview  
The Obstacle Avoidance Robot is an autonomous system designed to navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles. Using sensors like ultrasonic or infrared, it detects objects in its path and adjusts its movement to ensure collision-free operation. This project is ideal for learning robotics, sensor integration, and control systems.  

Features  
- Real-time Obstacle Detection: Detects objects using ultrasonic or infrared sensors.  
- Autonomous Navigation: Automatically adjusts direction to avoid collisions.  
- Modular Design: Easy to modify or expand functionality.  
- Low Power Consumption: Efficient hardware and software design.  

Components  
- Microcontroller: Arduino Uno (or similar).  
- Sensors: Ultrasonic or Infrared for obstacle detection.  
- Motor Driver: L298N or equivalent.  
- Motors: DC or servo motors for movement.  
- Power Supply: Battery (e.g., 9V or Li-ion).  
- Chassis: Robot base with wheels.  

How It Works  
1. The sensor continuously scans for obstacles within a predefined range.  
2. The microcontroller processes the data and adjusts the motor directions if an obstacle is detected.  
3. The robot changes its path to avoid the obstacle and continues moving forward.  

Setup Instructions  
1. Hardware Assembly:  
   - Connect the sensors to the microcontroller.  
   - Wire the motor driver and motors.  
   - Attach all components to the chassis.  

2. Software Setup:  
   - Install the Arduino IDE (if using Arduino).  
   - Upload the provided code to the microcontroller.  

3. Power Up:  
   - Connect the power supply and test the robot.
